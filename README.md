This study analyzes the application of reinforcement learning algorithms in the Snake game, focusing on the impact of optimizing reward mechanisms on agent performance. By introducing distance-based rewards, penalties for ineffective movements, and incentives for snake body length, the agent's performance significantly improved. The study also explores the relationship between the number of iterations and convergence speed, finding that data with a small degree of dispersion indicates faster convergence and stable training, while larger dispersion shows slower convergence and unstable training. To address slow convergence, it is recommended to increase the number of iterations to achieve more satisfactory results. This research provides important insights for further exploring the effectiveness of reinforcement learning algorithms.
The first code block is the implementation of the reward function before the improvements, while the second code block is the improved version. The subsequent code is for plotting. Due to device issues after the iterations were completed, the data was copied and created.
